  <p>ERNEST's site is an exploration of colors and shapes. A playground where logic meets coincidence. A suspicion of possibilities. An intimation of the unseen.</p>

<p>It is a place for the creation of collections of graphics. Each collection explores a theme. Collection items are made available on places like <a href="https://opensea.io/dre05119071">OpenSea</a> as non-fungible tokens. Collections tend to consist of 100 images. Most images on the site are JPGs of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Some are larger. Some are moving images in WEBP format.</p>

<p>The graphics are generated with Python scripts as two-dimensional images. The source code is changed after the image is drawn. Each image is therefore unique, irreplaceable, and can never be reproduced.</p>

<p>For images in other sizes and formats (such as SVGs), graphics outside of collections, moving images, special projects, or to acquire images directly, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">contact ERNEST</a>.</p>
